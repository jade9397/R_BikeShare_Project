Basic information on fictional Cyclistic Bike-Share company
* 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking Stations.
* Bike types: reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes
* Rider types: casual riders:1). purchase single-ride or full-day passes/70%
 My dataset is from May 2021 to April 2022, 12 months total.


Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 

A bike-share company can navigate speedy success by focusing on maximizing the number of annual memberships - convert casual riders into annual members.. This can be achieved by understanding how casual riders and annual members use the bikes differently, and designing a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

##**Conclusion**##

Based on the analysis, members primarily use the bikeshare for commuting and tasks while casual riders use it on weekends for excerse and recreasion. we can see that the average ride length varies by user type in month and week. 

* convert annuel members is difficult task!
* could create veriaty passes to attact more casual riders or encourage them to use more rides: peak season veriaty passes, 1 month, 2 months and 3 months pass or group rental pass; off hour special; 10 trips pass ... to attract more riders to increate revenue
* to put more ads through social midia to promote bikeshare program viserbility
